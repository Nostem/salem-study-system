# Radiation Monitoring

## Function

Radiation monitoring systems detect and measure radiation levels throughout the plant for personnel protection, effluent control, and post-accident monitoring. Process radiation monitors provide automatic actuation of safety functions (e.g., containment vent isolation) and alarms. The radiation protection program ensures that occupational radiation exposures are maintained as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and within 10CFR20 limits. (UFSAR 7.6, UFSAR 12)

## Process Radiation Monitors

<div class="callout callout-exam">
<div class="callout-label">Exam — 2023 Q49</div>
SGBD radiation monitor (<span class="hi-exam">1R19A</span>) check source test: when the check source pushbutton is pressed, counts rise then <span class="hi-exam">return to the original reading</span> (not held high while button is pressed). During the check source, <span class="hi-exam">interlocks are NOT expected to actuate</span>. (Ref: S1.OP-ST.RM-0001)
</div>

<div class="callout callout-exam">
<div class="callout-label">Exam — 2023 Q62</div>
1R1A (Control Room Area) radiation monitor in alarm: <span class="hi-trap">does NOT automatically actuate CAV in AP Mode</span>. Requires manual actuation — press ACCIDENT PRESSURIZED pushbutton at 1RP2 to actuate BOTH units' CAV into AP Mode. Emergency intake dampers open on the unaffected unit.

## Shielding Design

- Primary shielding: biological shield around the reactor vessel (concrete)
- Secondary shielding: containment structure, auxiliary building walls
- Designed to limit dose rates in normally occupied areas to levels consistent with 10CFR20 occupational limits
- Shielding design considers both normal operation and post-accident conditions
(UFSAR 12.1)

## Ventilation for Contamination Control

- Plant ventilation systems maintain appropriate pressure differentials to direct airflow from areas of lower contamination to areas of higher contamination
- HEPA filters and charcoal adsorbers on exhaust systems remove airborne contamination
- Containment purge system used to reduce airborne activity levels before personnel entry
(UFSAR 12.2)

## Radiation Protection Program

- Dosimetry: personnel monitoring for external and internal exposure
- Radiation surveys and monitoring
- Contamination control and decontamination
- Respiratory protection program
- Radioactive material control and accountability
- Training for all personnel with access to radiation areas
(UFSAR 12.3)

## ALARA Program

- Design features to minimize exposure: remote operation, shielding, ventilation, decontamination capability
- Administrative controls: radiation work permits, dose goals, pre-job ALARA reviews
- Dose tracking and trending
(UFSAR 12.4)

## Key Regulatory Limits (10CFR20)

| Parameter | Limit | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) | 5000 mrem/year | 10CFR20.1201 |

| Shallow Dose Equivalent (skin/extremity) | 50000 mrem/year | 10CFR20.1201 |
| Declared Pregnant Worker | 500 mrem/gestation | 10CFR20.1208 |
| General Public (fence line) | 100 mrem/year | 10CFR20.1301 |
